<H1>The Best Movies According to Sarah</H1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies Of All Time (in no particular order)</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings - Extended Trilogy</h3>
<p>I know it may be cheating to have three movies occupy one spot, but much like when it comes to chocolate: I can't just have one piece!
   Peter Jackson did a fantasic job of bringing J.R.R Tolkien's work to life. From the amazing sets and incredible costumes,
   to the gorgeous setting that is New Zealand and the stellar cast, this trilogy ticks all the boxes of a legendary movie series.</p>

<h3>Airplane!</h3>
<p>This is probably one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! With a mix of physical comedy and quotable script 
   ("Surely you can't be serious." "I am serious, And don't call me Shirley."), it will always be a movie I reach for when
   I need a little "pick-me up"!</p>

<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
   <p>Princess Mononoke is one of my favourite films, with the beautiful animation, strong characters and moving story, 
       it is a film that will stand the test of time.</p>
